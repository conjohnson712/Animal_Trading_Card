			<p>Emperor penguins are considered the largest penguins in the world, and also hold claim for the deepest dives
				among penguins. Unlike other species of penguin, Emperors do not build nests; instead, they combine their 
				feet and brood patches to supply warmth to their eggs. Emperors, like many other penguins, will leap out of
				the water. This action coats them in small air bubbles, allowing for faster aquatic movement upon landing.
